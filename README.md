# Challenge-14-Tableau

##Overview of Analysis
There has been interest in starting a bike sharing company in Des Moines, Iowa.The group that is seeking to start this new adventure has asked up to pull together an analysis based on the NYC Citibike rental company. For this analysis, we focused just on one month (AUgust 2019).

##Results
The start and stop locations for the bike rentals followa very similar trend. The higher volume can be found in areas that have increased tourists popularity. 
There are two usertype categories. The first is Subscribers and the second is short-term Customers. Subcribers are generally local NYCers who use the bikes to communte around the city. SHort-term CUstomers are generally tourists visiting the city. Subscribers make up 81% of the users in NYC during the month of August while short-term customers made up 19%. That is good that well over 50% of the customers come from subscribers. If we dig a little deeper, males make up 35% of the subscribers, while women make up 22 and unknown makes up 43%. If we look at the overall users by gender, Males pupolate the bikes by 65%. Females make up 25% and unknow make up only 10%.
THe days the get the most usages are MOnday, Tuesday, Thursday, adn Friday.THe weekends are pretty steady as well. These days are heavily dominated by subscribers.

##Summary
To recap, Male subscribers make up a bigger portion of the bike utilization. Having more subscribers is a good thing. These type of users can generate a steady cashflow while having reliable customers. The downfall of our analysis is that it focuses on only month month. I would suggest to broaded the timeframe to a year or two. THis would give us a good sense of stability during the winder months. Des Moines Iowa is completely different part of the country. The winters may be harsher and throughfore may generate a big downturn in customers during that time. It would also be good to look at maitenance fees. THe winter months may see an increase of maintance due to road conditions ro falls.
